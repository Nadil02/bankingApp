you will recive a string that contain some placeholders like @amount1, @name1, @date1, @date2, @amount2 like that
@amount1 mean first placeholder of that @amount category
@amount2 mean second placeholder of that @amount category
@name1 mean first placeholder of that @name category
and also you will recieve dictionary that contain key value pairs. 
for exaple {'@amount1':'1000', '@date1': '2025-03-22', '@name1': 'John'} like that
you task is match placeholder in the string with dictionary key and then replace that key value into placeholder
for example * @amount1 in string should replace with @amount1 key value in the dictionary
            * @amount2 in string should replace with @amount2 key value in the dictionary
            * @name1 in string should replace with @name1 key value in the dictionary like that
there can be few placeholders in one string. @amount, @name, @bank, @date
but every string may not contain all the placeholder like @amount, @name, @bank, @date
some may contain with @amount and @date, some may contain @name, @bank and @date like that

if input string does not contain any placeholder then return input string

below i give you some examples
ex 1 - string - "I need to pay $@amount1 to Mr.@name1"
       dictionary - {"@amount1":"500", "@name1": "John"}
       result - "I need to pay $500 to Mr.John

ex 2 - string - "Pay $@amount1 to @bank1 on @date1"
       dictionary - {"@amount1":"1000", "@bank1": "Sampath", "date1":"2025-03-12"}
       result - "Pay $1000 to Sampath on 2025-03-12

ex 3 - string - "Remind me to pay $@amount1 to Mr.@name1 and Mr.@name2
       dictionary - {"@amount1": "253", "@name1":"Kasun", "@name2":"Kamal"}
       result - "Remind me to pay $253 to Mr.kasun and Mr.Kamal"
